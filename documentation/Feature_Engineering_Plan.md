# Feature Engineering Plan

## Introduction
Feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline for our project. It aims to transform raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of our predictive models. Effective feature engineering can enhance the model's accuracy, reduce overfitting, and simplify the interpretation of the results.

## Data Overview
The dataset we are working with includes numerical, categorical, and temporal data. Key characteristics and findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) relevant to feature engineering include:

- **Numerical Data**: Various continuous features with potential skewness and outliers.
- **Categorical Data**: Multiple categorical variables that require encoding.
- **Temporal Data**: Time series data that exhibit trends and seasonal patterns.

## Feature Engineering Strategies

### Feature Creation
**Temporal Features**
- **Weekday vs. Weekend**: Indicate whether a transaction occurred on a weekday or weekend.
- **Time of Day**: Categorize transactions into time slots (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening).
- **Holiday Effect**: Mark days close to major holidays, which might influence behavior.

**Polynomial Features**
- Create polynomial features from existing numerical features to capture non-linear relationships.

### Feature Transformation
**Normalization/Standardization**
- Scale features using normalization or standardization to ensure algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude perform optimally.

**Encoding Categorical Variables**
- Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

### Feature Selection
**Filter Methods**
- Use statistical tests or correlation analyses to select relevant features.

**Wrapper Methods**
- Implement algorithms like recursive feature elimination to identify valuable features.

**Embedded Methods**
- Utilize models that perform feature selection as part of the fitting process, such as Lasso regression.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- Employ techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the number of features in high-dimensional data.

### Handling Missing Values
- Implement imputation methods or use indicators for missingness to handle missing data effectively.

### Domain-Specific Features
- Engineer features based on domain knowledge that might not be evident from the data alone.

## Implementation Plan
- Utilize pandas, scikit-learn, and other relevant libraries to implement feature engineering steps in the data processing pipeline.
- Integrate feature engineering steps into the data preprocessing workflow, ensuring they are applied consistently during model training and evaluation.

## Evaluation and Iteration
- Evaluate the impact of feature engineering on model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Iterate on the feature engineering process based on model feedback, continuously refining the features to enhance model performance.

## Example Section: Temporal Features
Given the time series nature of our dataset, extracting temporal features is crucial for capturing patterns related to time. We plan to implement the following temporal features:

- **Weekday vs. Weekend**: Indicate whether a transaction occurred on a weekday or weekend, as spending patterns may differ.
- **Time of Day**: Categorize transactions into time slots (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) to capture daily spending rhythms.
- **Holiday Effect**: Mark days close to major holidays, which might influence spending behavior.

These features will be extracted using pandas datetime functionalities, leveraging the `.dt` accessor to extract specific components from datetime columns.
