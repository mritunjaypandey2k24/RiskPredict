# RiskPredict - AI-Driven Risk Management (Hackathon Project)

## Project Overview
RiskPredict is an AI-driven solution developed for a hackathon challenge. The goal is to enhance the risk management capabilities of a bank. By leveraging Azure Machine Learning and Azure Databricks, RiskPredict aims to analyze large datasets to identify potential risks and anomalies in real-time. It provides predictive insights for market, credit, and operational risks, and generates actionable risk mitigation strategies while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to address the current risk management processes that are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. They struggle to identify risks in real-time and lack predictive capabilities.

## Proposed Solution
RiskPredict uses Azure Machine Learning to develop predictive models that can identify potential risks based on transaction data, customer data, and market data. Azure Databricks is used for large-scale data processing tasks.

## Benefits
RiskPredict will enable the bank to identify risks in real-time, predict future risks, and generate risk mitigation strategies. This will lead to reduced losses, improved regulatory compliance, and enhanced customer trust.

## Implementation Plan
The hackathon timeline is as follows:
- Data collection and analysis: 2 weeks
- Model development and testing: 3 weeks
- Integration: 1 week

## Challenges & Risks
Potential challenges include ensuring data privacy and security, integrating with existing systems, and ensuring the accuracy of our predictive model. We plan to address these by leveraging Azure's built-in security features, working closely with the bank's IT team, and continuously testing and refining our model.

## Hackathon Progress

### Update - [16-06-2024]

- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Successfully collected initial datasets for analysis, focusing on the banking sector and market indices. The datasets include:
  - Stock Prices: BANKBARODA.csv, HDFCBANK.csv, ICICIBANK.csv, SBIN.csv, AXISBANK.csv
  - Market Indices: Nifty50.csv, BSE_Sensex.csv
  Preliminary analysis has been initiated to identify patterns and potential risk indicators within these datasets.
- **Model Development**: Began the development of predictive models using Azure Machine Learning, with an initial focus on market risk prediction based on the collected stock prices and market indices.

*Note: This section will continue to be updated with daily progress throughout the hackathon.*
