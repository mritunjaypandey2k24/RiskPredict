# RiskPredict - AI-Driven Risk Management (Hackathon Project)

## Bank of Baroda Hackathon 2024

## Project Overview
RiskPredict is an AI-driven solution developed for a hackathon challenge, aimed at enhancing the risk management capabilities of banks. Leveraging Azure Machine Learning and Azure Databricks, it analyzes large datasets to identify potential risks and anomalies in real-time, offering predictive insights for market, credit, and operational risks, and generating actionable risk mitigation strategies while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement
Current risk management processes are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone, struggling to identify risks in real-time and lacking predictive capabilities.

## Proposed Solution
RiskPredict utilizes Azure Machine Learning for developing predictive models based on transaction data, customer data, and market data, with Azure Databricks handling large-scale data processing tasks.

## Benefits
- **Real-time Risk Identification**: Enables the bank to detect risks as they occur.
- **Predictive Insights**: Forecasts future risks, allowing for proactive risk management.
- **Actionable Strategies**: Generates strategies for risk mitigation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures compliance with financial regulations.
- **Enhanced Customer Trust**: Builds trust through improved risk management.

## Implementation Plan
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: 2 weeks
- **Model Development and Testing**: 3 weeks
- **Integration**: 1 week

## Challenges & Risks
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring the protection of sensitive information.
- **System Integration**: Integrating with existing banking systems.
- **Model Accuracy**: Continuously refining the model for accurate predictions.
